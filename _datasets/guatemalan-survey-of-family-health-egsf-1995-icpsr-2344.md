title: 'Guatemalan Survey of Family Health (EGSF), 1995 (ICPSR 2344)'
organization: Anne Pebley
notes: >-
  The Guatemalan Survey of Family Health (EGSF) was undertaken to investigate
  the health of children under the age of five and women during pregnancy and
  childbirth residing in 60 communities within the departments (geopolitical
  units) of Chimaltenango, Suchitepequez, Totonicapan, and Jalapa in Guatemala.
  Data were collected at the household, individual, and community levels to gain
  an in-depth understanding of the way residents in these rural populations
  think about their health, treatment, and family relations. Data at the
  household level (Parts 1-5, 90-92) provide information on household members,
  relation to household head, age, education, and language used. The
  individual-level data (Parts 6-37) describe the respondent's background,
  marital/relationship history, social ties and social support, and economic
  status, along with health beliefs, a complete birth history, knowledge and use
  of contraception, health problems and treatment during the last two
  pregnancies, and anthropometry on mothers and children. Extensive data were
  gathered regarding the health problems and treatment for each of the two
  youngest children born since January 1990, with particular focus on diarrhea
  and respiratory infections. The community data (Parts 41-60) supply
  information gathered from three knowledgeable individuals called "key
  informants" about occupations in the community, crops grown, wages, utilities
  and community services, and the history of the community. Parts 61-89 contain
  information regarding Health Posts (health care centers) through interviews
  conducted with key informants, doctors (Parts 72-80), and other health service
  providers (Parts 81-89), including traditional providers such as curers,
  midwives, and bone setters, regarding their practices, patients, referrals,
  fees, payment, and the use of specific treatments.
